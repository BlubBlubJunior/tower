How did it go:

The experience went quite smoothly, despite a few minor mistakes. I began with minimal coding knowledge, but as I progressed, I gained a deep understanding of coding and uncovered the reasons behind my love for it.

What you've learned:

1.  How to use different code components together.
2.  The importance of looking up information when needed, which is a valuable skill in programming.

What you can improve:

Spawning System: You can enhance your game by implementing a more dynamic spawning system, such as using a raycast system to spawn objects or enemies in more strategic locations.

Music: Adding music to your game can significantly enhance the overall gaming experience and make it more engaging for players.

Enemy HP: It's important to fine-tune the health points (HP) of enemies to ensure a balanced and challenging gameplay experience.

Spawning System Count: You mentioned that the spawning system count doesn't give the right number. Fixing this issue is essential for the proper functioning of your game.

Wave System: Implementing a wave system can add structure and progression to your game, making it more enjoyable for players.

Playable Upgrades: Introducing playable upgrades can make the game more dynamic and provide players with a sense of progression and customization.

Balancing: Adjusting the game's difficulty by giving enemy units the ability to damage your towers can add a layer of challenge, but it's crucial to balance it properly to maintain an enjoyable experience.
